Solution:

CREATE TABLE accounts(
accno int NOT NULL,
customername char(50) NOT NULL,
branch int,
type char(50),
openingdate date,
currentbalance int NOT NULL
);

insert into accounts values(0001,'Joshua',5028,'Current','08-08-2015',150000);
insert into accounts values(0005,'Vyshnav',5025,'Savings','25-06-2012',100000);
insert into accounts values(0003,'Rovn',5028,'Savings','20-12-2018',80000);
insert into accounts values(0007,'Vaishnav',5028,'Savings','22-10-2018',125000);

SELECT AVG(currentbalance) As averagebalance
FROM accounts;

SELECT COUNT(accno)
FROM accounts;


SELECT MAX(currentbalance)
FROM accounts;

SELECT branch,COUNT(type) as account_type
FROM accounts
GROUP BY branch;

SELECT customername,COUNT(type) as account_type
FROM accounts
GROUP BY customername
HAVING COUNT(type)>1;

SELECT customername,COUNT(*)
FROM accounts
GROUP BY branch
HAVING branch IN(SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE openingdate>'03-01-2015');

SELECT branch,COUNT(accno) as accounts
FROM accounts
GROUP BY branch;

SELECT branch,COUNT(type) as account_type
FROM accounts
GROUP BY branch;
